Unlike homophonic music (melody + chord accompaniment), counterpoint treats each voice as a melody in its own right.\n\nThe word comes from Latin "punctus contra punctum" — "point against point" or "note against note."\n\nCounterpoint reached its peak in the Baroque era with J.S. Bach, whose fugues combine up to 5 independent voices in astonishing complexity. But counterpoint principles apply to all music — any time a bass line, vocal melody, and guitar riff all have their own melodic shape, counterpoint is at work.`,
